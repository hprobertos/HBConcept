# HBConcept
Javascript/HTML/MySQL/PHP online shopping as a school project

I do not own most of the content used in this project like: 
* Images 
* Public code used. 
* Company names

I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## History of the project
The point of the project was to simulate the work suing the SCRUM methodology by creating a webpage for a real client. The client asked
for features that were added every day as a team, by using SCRUM points, dayly meetings and SCRUM stories. It was never used for real, but
it was a prototype of a real project.

## How to use
### IT´S NOT COMPLETE
This project was only a prototype that showed a catalog, the shopping feature, the cart feature and the simulation of a real webpage. It 
was implemented with a Database where we filled the inventory with prices, quantity and other properties, but nothing more. The other
purpose of the project was to help us learn the use of the frameworks and personalization that brings. 

You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my hard work. Have fun!
